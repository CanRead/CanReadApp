# CanRead

eBooks are awesome -- all those bells and whistles, videos, links to click, buttons!  

They're not so awesome if you're one of the millions of people who have dyslexia or another language-based learning disability.  

CanRead extracts a stream of text from an e-book and hands it to Spritz, a technology that shows one word at a time, with one letter highlighted at the optimal recognition point to help a reader quickly grasp each word.  

# How CanRead Was Created

CanRead was created at the [Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Creative Codefest](http://curiouscodefest.hmhco.com/), a hackathon that took place in Boston, MA on June 26-27, 2015.  

# Team 

CanRead was created by [Noah Teshu](https://github.com/Noah-T), [Yee Ling Gan](https://github.com/funtowrite) [Elaine], [Lisa Williams](http://github.com/lisawilliams), [Simon Tran](https://github.com/smn1022), and Josh 

# Tools 

CanRead is primarily a Javascript application that makes use of two primary APIs: 

* The [HMH Content API](https://developer.hmhco.com/api-guide#10.5) to extract text from eBooks; 
* The [Spritz SDK](http://www.spritzinc.com/developers/).
