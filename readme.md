#CanRead

eBooks are awesome -- all those bells and whistles, videos, links to click, buttons!  

They're not so awesome if you're one of the millions of people who have dyslexia or another language-based learning disability.  

CanRead extracts a stream of text from an e-book and hands it to Spritz, a technology that shows one word at a time, with one letter highlighted at the optimal recognition point to help a reader quickly grasp each word.
